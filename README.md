# ProteinPurifier

## Introduction
This repository contains the Python application and custom **czpurifier** package that have been designed for automated protein purification by the CZ Biohub - SF Bioengineering team. All utilities support Python 3.7. Note that newer versions of Python are not compatible.

*This is a public snapshot of the automated protein purification repo as described in our 2023 preprint **PREPRINT LINK**.*

Maintenance of this repo is the responsibility of Robert Puccinelli. Please direct any communication to Robert Puccinelli via creation of an Issue at the project repo **FINAL REPO NAME ISSUES LINK**.

## Installation and Use
### Installing Module
1. Install PyQt5 globally (required to access pyqt5 package on the virtual environment). Run the command:
    >> sudo apt-get update<br>
    >> sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5<br>
2. Create and activate a virtual environment in a convenient location with Python3
3. Clone or download this repository
4. Navigate to the base of the repository
5. Install setuptools (__pip install setuptools__)
6. Install module (__pip install .__)

NOTE: Developers may want to install the module with __pip install -e .__ so that changes they make to the module are immediately reflected in the next import.

### Updating Module from Repository
1. Pull changes from remote repository
2. Activate virtual environment with previous install
3. Navigate to the module directory
4. Update module (__pip install . --upgrade__)

### Using GUI
1. If running the GUI for the first time, locate ProteinPurifier/czpurifier/ui/purification_parameters.json and update the PURIFIER_IP to refer to the ip of the instrument.
2. Go to the base of the directory and run:
    >> python3 czpurifier/ui/main_window_gui.py

### Using Module
1. Edit files to include `import czpurifier` or a variant such as `from czpurifier import {class_name}`
2. Activate virtual environment with module installed
3. Execute python script or application

## Usage
The user interface was designed to simplify operation and strips away most arguments needed to operate the machine. A list of methods and basic examples of how to use them can be found at: https://github.com/czbiohub/ProteinPurifier/tree/master/czpurifier/ui

Scripts that have been used for set up, clean up or various experiments can be found at: https://github.com/czbiohub/ProteinPurifier/tree/master/scripts
